**Never lose your Browser's URL history again.** 

## What is SaveTabs?

SaveTabs is a **Chrome extension** and **local daemon** used for keeping track of your Tab's URLs you visit and the Tab Groups in which you organize them keeping you from ever loosing them.

SaveTabs stores all your data **locally** _(by default)_ on your own computer in a Sqlite database for which you have full control and privacy.
